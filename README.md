Hello friends and welcome to gofar09's tic-tac-toe-client README.md.

Background:
This project is the first of several for General Assemlby's Web Development
Immersive course. Our goal was to build from nothing a working tic tac toe
app housed within a github delpoyed site and fulfill various requirements. This
was my first ever coding project and all of this was learned during the previous
four weeks.

Technology used:
HTML 5
JavaScript
jQuery
CSS
gitHub

Process:
My initial wireframes can be founds here: https://imgur.com/a/wn5XWBD

These were my first user stories:
  -As a user, I can make an account with my email and a password.

  -As a user, I can have a username for my account.

  -As a user, I can sign in to my account.

  -As a user, I can play tic tac toe.

  -As a user, I can play tic tac toe against another use on another machine

  -As a user, I can see the email/username of my opponent

I began the process by building a very basic grid of 9 squares as a placeholder.
I wanted to start on the game logic first because it was what I believed would
be the most difficult aspect of the project. We had practiced api work, some
styling, and JS functions, but had never done anything nearly as complicated as
the game engine. My primary goal for most of the project was simply to execute
simply but excellently and delivery a MVP that satisfied the basic requirements
due to my inexperience as a developer.

While some aspects of the engine design were less difficult than I had
anticipated, others were relatively simple. I thought my solution to determining
whether it was time to display an X or O, by checking the value of a Boolean
variable then banging it to switch it for next turn was a simple and effective
solution. On the other hand I struggled quite a bit with designing proper loops
to check my array of win states, and particularly struggled with showing draw
states.

My styling is probably where I went most of the box. I was unhappy with the
limited options for making a tic tac toe site interesting and eye-catching,
so I decided to make a site that looked as little like a game site as possible.
I wanted to try and emulate the "hero image" style I had heard mentioned about,
and my goal was to completely disguise my site as something completely
unrelated. Due to time constraints I wasn't able to achieve this effect as
fully as I would have wanted. If I come back to this project, that would be a
goal of mine. Additionally, I'd like to explore the API connections more deeply
and find different ways of using the database of games available. That was one
area where I feel I could have greatly improved. Overall though, I'm extremely
happy with my final product.

Lastly, a list of some issues I want to work on going forward are:
  -Button placement, sizing, colors.
  -Better feedback message displays
  -Enhanced API linkage
  -Dual sign Ins 
  -Multi-device, multi-player

Thanks for checking it out, I hope you find it interesting!
